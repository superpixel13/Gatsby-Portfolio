# About me
## I'm a passionate person who loves developing and learn new stuffs.
I have been learning programming since 2017 and from then i've grown to love it already.
I've learned many things from college to personal experience, from Professors teaching me
the basic logical structures and basic fundamentals of programming to Me experiencing and creating
Frontend Components and Backend Structures. So you see Learning is what i love and Challenging Problems
is what i yearn for, so if you got one for me please contact me below ( Footer of the Page ) and let's 
talk about it.
